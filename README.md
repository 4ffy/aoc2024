# Advent of Code 2024

It's another [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solution set. After
all, If I don't save Christmas, who will? You best be thankful.

## Languages

In order of importance / consistency:

 - **Python**: Great for prototyping the others.
 - **Common Lisp**: My "challenge" language.
 - **C and/or C++**: Depending on the problem. Usually I do both if the solution
   is meaningfully different. (Sometimes C++ is just "C with std::vector.")
 - **Rust**: Lots of the time a Rust solution is functionally identical to one
   of the above so the extra time spent isn't particularly enlightening.
 - **AWK**: Great for parsing early days, but once you hit graph structures and
   such, you're left with C but with worse array semantics.
 - **Fennel**: If I'm in the mood.
